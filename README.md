# Arduino-Car-Data-Old-2013
An obsolete project of my own based on an online tutorial. 
Basically Arduino is connected to hacked ELM327 chip with OBD port of the car and sends codes to the onboard CAN network and when a certain sensor or device is invoked with its corresponding code, it returns it's data back.Then Arduino displays it.
